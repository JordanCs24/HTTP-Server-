This project is to help me learn

How to directly work with sockets, memory management, and concurrency primitives

This will better help me understand optimization trade-offs firsthand

Systems programming experience: Critical for OS, networking, and embedded roles

Resume impact: "Built a multi-threaded HTTP server in C++" impresses more than Python

This helps me build for other projects such as - You'll gain skills for game engines, databases, etc.

What I am Specifically Learn in C++:
Socket programming with sys/socket.h (POSIX sockets)

Memory management (avoiding leaks, smart pointers)

Concurrency with std::thread, mutexes, condition variables

RAII patterns for resource management

Zero-copy techniques for performance

I/O multiplexing with poll() or epoll() (advanced)
